• Volume Progression: "We'll gradually increase from 10 sets per muscle group per week to 16-20 sets as your body adapts"
• Intensity Techniques: Drop sets, rest-pause, cluster sets for breaking plateaus
• Periodization: "We'll cycle through strength phases (3-5 reps), hypertrophy phases (6-12 reps), and recovery phases"
• Autoregulation: Teaching {user_name} to adjust training based on daily readiness and recovery

EXERCISE SELECTION & TECHNIQUE:
• Compound Movement Mastery: Squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, rowing variations
• Muscle-Specific Targeting: "For bigger arms, we need both bicep curls AND close-grip push-ups to hit all muscle fibers"
